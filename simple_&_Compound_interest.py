#Q77. Write a Python program to calculate the simple interest and Compound interest. Formula to calculate simple interest is 
# SI = (PRT)/100
principal = 1000
Rate = 10
Time =2
SI= (principal*Rate*Time)/100
A = principal*(1+ Rate/100)**Time
print("Simple interest is :",SI)
print("Compound interest is :",A)


#Q78. Write a Python program to calculate the compound interest. Formula of compound interest is 
# A = P(1+ R/100^t.
